                        <p> sydney does coffee differently than in the US and it’s <br>
                                defintely something to get used to. we were there during <br>
                                summer time so naturally wanted our drinks to be iced. whenever <br>
                                we would order an iced coffee it would come with coffee, <br> 
                                    sugar/sweetening up, ice cream, ice and whipped cream. if you <br>
                                    like dessert for breakfast then you’re in the clear but otherwise <br>
                                    you’re better off ordering a hot drink or making your own iced drinks. <br>

                        <h3>University of Copenhagen Engineering Exchange</h3>
                        <p> The Copenhagen Engineering Exchange program is <br>
                            actually located in Lyngby, Denmark! The location is <br> 
                            misadvertised, but Denmark itself is so small and flat <br>
                            that biking between the school and city is common for students. <br>
                             A decent bike will run you back about 1000DK, but it is a <br> 
                             worthwhile investment for the exchange and you can usually sell it <br>
                             to an incoming student. For all you short people out there, you might <br>
                             be able to get away with children's bikes as the Danes are very tall! <br>

                        <p> If you're trying to do some shopping, 50% is not enough, cut the price by <br>
                            75%, and you're still probably getting ripped off. But hey, it's a win-win <br>
                            on both ends. Also, the kids are going to want to add you on wechat! <br> 
                            Add them, they're so great. <br>
