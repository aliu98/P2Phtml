                            <p> "The Copenhagen Engineering Exchange program is 
                                actually located in Lyngby, Denmark! The location is 
                                misadvertised, but Denmark itself is so small and flat 
                                that biking between the school and city is common for students. 
                                 A decent bike will run you back about 1000DK, but it is a 
                                 worthwhile investment for the exchange and you can usually sell it
                                 to an incoming student. For all you short people out there, you might                                      
                                 be able to get away with children's bikes as the Danes are very tall!" <br>

                        <p> "Sydney does coffee differently than in the US and it's
                            defintely something to get used to. we were there during
                            summer time so naturally wanted our drinks to be iced. whenever
                            we would order an iced coffee it would come with coffee, 
                            sugar/sweetening up, ice cream, ice and whipped cream. if you 
                            like dessert for breakfast then you're in the clear but otherwise 
                            you're better off ordering a hot drink or making your own iced drinks." <br>
