# Lab 1 CS52: Landing Page
### Amber Liu

##What Worked
*worked with varying font types and also separating the webpage into different divisions with classes 
*flexboxes galore

##What Didn't Work
*Need to work on hamburger menu
*Would have liked the nav bar hover effect to turn blue and underline
*Worked on animating the words using CSS and need to figure out how to backspace typewriter and also stop the cursor from going to the very end of the page 
*would like to format the text without adding breaks (use margins instead)
